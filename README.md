# LottoProject
The program is Lotto, where users play a game to guess a number. The users
can input a number from 100-999 and the program generates 100 random numbers
between 100-999. If the number guessed is one of the 100 random numbers 
generated, the user wins. However, if the user does not guess one of those
numbers, the user loses. The user can decide to continue playing or not 
and if they decide to quit, the program will show the win and loss count.

Lotto2 is where users play a game to guess a number. The users
can input a number from 100-999 and the program generates 100 random numbers
between 100-999. If the number guessed is one of the 100 random numbers 
generated, the user wins. However, if the user does not guess one of those
numbers, the user loses. The user can decide to continue playing or not 
and if they decide to quit, the program will show the win and loss count.
Lotto has been upgraded to Lotto2. This program uses binary search and 
selection or bubble sort to be more efficient in the long run.
